Ignore OLD OOP project as it was more event driven than general oop concepts, while it still is not true event driven as the input listener object does a "frame loop"
i will not take chances and i changed it into something more like oop structure

other than that these are the files for the final project of programming course, all rights to meeeeeeeeee
